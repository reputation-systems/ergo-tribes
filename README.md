Certain services become more efficient and profitable when executed on a large scale, that is, utilizing a significant amount of resources. To achieve this, it is beneficial for multiple parties to come together to carry out these services. Some examples of these cases include:

1. **Cryptocurrency mining**: Mining requires a substantial amount of computational and energy resources. When multiple parties collaborate, they can combine their resources to mine cryptocurrencies more efficiently and share the rewards.

2. **Targeted marketing campaigns**: To attract consumers who do not use the Celaut paradigm, multiple communication channels such as WeChat, web pages, Android applications, Telegram, etc., can be utilized. By bringing together several parties, the reach and effectiveness of the campaign can be maximized.

3. **Large-scale AI models**: Training and operating large-scale AI models require significant processing power and data. Collaboration among multiple parties can facilitate the creation and utilization of these models.

4. **Simulation and service testing**: Performing complex simulations and exhaustive testing to create reputation proofs requires substantial resources. By joining forces, these activities can be conducted more effectively.

To coordinate collaboration among multiple parties without the need for mutual trust, smart contracts can be utilized. These contracts are programs that run on a blockchain and automatically enforce the agreed-upon terms between the parties. In this context, these contracts are executed on the Ergo blockchain. Through smart contracts, the terms of collaboration can be established and regulated, ensuring that all parties fulfill their commitments and receive the corresponding rewards.

CELAUT nodes, in turn, can stake on the execution of these services. This means that nodes can commit resources and participate in the execution of the services in exchange for a reward. This staking system helps ensure that services are executed efficiently and that resources are used optimally.
